#### Why split?
For faster downloads and to be able to upload it as GitHub file upload has a 25MB limit.

#### How to submit an app?
Just open up a issue and tell more about the app there and put the download link there as well, or the split-files.

> Currently only supports windows apps, but working on the downloader and it will support any os's files.
